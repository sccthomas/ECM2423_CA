## Welcome to my A* and DFS maze Solver

### How to Use
- Run either the file Question_1.py or Question_2.py, Q1 is DFS and Q2 is A*. 
- Run the program and choose option 1 to start solving.
- Input a maze file including its type i.e. maze-Easy.txt. 
- The maze will be solved and the solving statistics will be outputted in the console 
- A new file named after the original file + "solved" will be made where you can view the solved maze. 
- The path will be dotted out with X's, the best way to view the path is to press ctrl f and x. Which will highlight the path
- However, this solved maze text file must be opened in an IDE where it can properly formatted, otherwise it will be compressed to a certain width and the solution will not be displayed correctly.
